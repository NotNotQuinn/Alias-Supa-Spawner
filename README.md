# Supibot Alias Package Manager

This script is meant to be run as an alias

## The Idea
This is a script meant to be an alias package manager, I saw someone 
else try to make this at one point and I want to try as well :) I am 
going to make this in JavaScript then add it to a pastebin and use 
`pastebin get <paste id>` although this has a max character ammount 
of 50,000 I think it will work (much better than using the `$math` 
command)


#### TODO
- [ ] Fix Publish Workflow, it works but doesnt know that it works.
